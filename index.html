    <p>Hello everyone! I'm so excited to going
         through this class with you. 
        I am a father of 3 young boys 
        8,6 and 3. Our oldest is turning 
        8 in a few days
        and will be babtised next month! 
        My family and I love to be outdoors 
        hiking, fishing or camping every chance
         we get. My wife and I have been married 
         for over 11 years now. We were married
          in the Mesa temple in Arizona. I have 
          been working in retail for the last 
          10 years and am excited to be learning
          a new skill and going back to school.
    </p>
